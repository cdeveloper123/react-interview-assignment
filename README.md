# React.js / Next.js / Chakra UI / TanStack Query interview assignment
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [`Chakra UI`](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/getting-started/nextjs-app-guide).

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repo on GitHub and clone it to your local PC.

2. Install Node.js

3. Run
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

4. Run
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## The task
On the [/](/) route create a list of accordions displaying the information from the public API https://reqres.in/api/users. If needed, you can query the information for a single user on https://reqres.in/api/users/{id}.

Clicking on the user's first name will redirect the user to [/profile/{id}](/profile/{id}) where ID is the user's ID. 
The [/profile/{id}](/profile/{id}) page will show the clicked user's information.

Use Next.js for routing, Chakra UI for components and styling and TanStack Query for querying the API.

Push your changes to your repository and get ready to present your code at the interview by sharing your screen.

Good luck! ðŸ™‚
